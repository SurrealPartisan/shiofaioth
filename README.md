# Shiofaioth (Ciofaiod)
Shiofaioth is an anarchist and feminist engineered language (engelang). It's purpose is to be as unsuitable for authoritarian propaganda as possible, so that it is difficult to hide power structures behind word choices. A secondary goal is certain kind of airy, whispery aesthetics. Shiofaioth is a work in progress, and this document will be updated.

## Phonology and ortography
### Consonants

|               | Bilabial | Labiodental | Dental | Alveolar | Postalveolar | Lateral | Velar | Uvular | Glottal |
| ------------: | :------: | :---------: | :----: | :------: | :----------: | :-----: | :---: | :----: | :-----: |
| **Plosive**   | p        |             | t      |          |              |         | k     |        |         |
| **Nasal**     | m        |             | n      |          |              |         |       |        |         |
| **Fricative** | b        | f           | d      | s        | c            | l       | x     | r      | h       |

The plosives are aspirated and voiceless, the nasals are voiced and the fricatives are voiceless. The uvular fricative may also be pronounced as a trill.

### Vowels

|           | Front | Back  |
| --------: | :---: | :---: |
| **Close** | i     | u*    |
| **Mid**   | e     | o*    |
| **Open**  |       | a     |

An asterisk marks rounded vowels.

All possible diphthongs and thriphthongs are allowed.

### Phonotactics
The syllable structure in Shiofaioth is (C)V(C), where V can be a monophthong, diphthong or triphthong. The beginning consonant can be omitted in a word-initial syllable, and the ending consonant may only be present on a word-final syllable. Thus, there are no consonant clusters. As postpositions and other particles are often connected to other words with hyphens, that may seem to break this rule, but they are technically separate words. The connecting is done for aesthetics and clarity.

### Stress
The stress is on the last syllable of the word.

## Grammar

### Nouns
Nouns in Shiofaioth are preceded by articles. An article consists of three parts: a prefix indicating definiteness and specificity (can be none), a base form indicating noun class, and a suffix indicating case (can be none).

#### Noun classes
Nouns are divided into three classes:

1. things that can be owned in functional sense or naturally belong to someone: my food, your car, her body. Class 1 uses article base form "ei".

2. things that can't necessarily be owned, but which can be named so that they are defined by someone's (or something's?) relationship to them: my home, your pet, his boyfriend. Class 2 uses article base form "ai".

3. things that exist for themselves: a human, the weather, the world. Class 3 uses article base form "ui".

Proper nouns may be used without article when the case is obvious. If an article is needed, a class 3 article is used.

#### Definiteness and specificity
The prefix of an article indicates both [definiteness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness) and [specificity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specificity_(linguistics)) of the noun. They are as follows:

|                 | Definite | Indefinite |
| --------------: | :------: | :--------: |
| **Specific**    | d-       | h-         |
| **Nonspecific** | f-       | -          |

For example, here are four translations for the sentence "I am looking for my mother":
 
* "Mie xae-eiciae-duei *dain* paurein-bei-nais miem-ka."  
(definite, specific)  
Interpretation: I have one mother, whom I know, and I am trying to find her.

* "Mie xae-eiciae-duei *fain* paurein-bei-nais miem-ka."  
(definite, nonspecific)  
Interpretation: I don't know who my one and only mother is, but I am trying to find her.

* "Mie xae-eiciae-duei *hain* paurein-bei-nais miem-ka."  
(indefinite, specific)  
Interpretation: I am trying to find a certain one of my multiple mothers.

* "Mie xae-eiciae-duei *ain* paurein-bei-nais miem-ka."  
(indefinite, nonspecific)  
Interpretation: I am trying to find any one of my multiple mothers.

These are potentially not the only possible interpretations, but should illuminate the meanings of definiteness and specificity.

#### Noun cases
Shiofaioth has nine noun cases, each marked with an article suffix as listed in the following table:

| Case         | Suffix |
| -----------: | :----: |
| Nominative   | -      |
| Genitive     | -c     |
| Accusative   | -n     |
| Dative       | -m     |
| Locative     | -l     |
| Lative       | -t     |
| Separative   | -x     |
| Comitative   | -k     |
| Instrumental | -p     |
| Vocative     | -f     |

The cases are used as follows:
* **Nominative**: Used for the subject of a sentence, and often for a predicative.
  * Example 1 (subject): "*Dai opiadaefa* xae-bailei-duei.", "The teacher is dancing."
  * Example 2 (predicative): "Mie xae-ecoi-duei *hui peib*", "I am a non-binary person."
* **Genitive** Used for class 1 possession, either in adjectival form with the postposition "ki" or independently (usually as a predicative) without it. The independent form with the verb "ecoi" can be used to translate "to have".
  * Example 1 (adjectival form): "dei haumeir *duic raiboudifa-ki*", "the hammer of the worker"
  * Example 2 (independent form): "Dei leip xae-ecoi-duei *duic kouofeitifa*.", "The bread is the cook's."
  * Example 3 ("to have"): "*Deic haus* soe-ecoi-duei ei puero duos.", "The house has two doors." (It is typical but not necessary to put the possessor to the beginning of the sentence.)
* **Accusative**: Used for the direct object and with postpositions "four" ("for", "because of") and "koaxein" ("against" in the non-physical sense).
  * Example 1 (direct object): "Hai toroic xae-baisen-xoai *hain poulaisifa*.", "a tortoise bites a cop (defiantly)".
  * Example 2 (with a postposition): "Mie xae-doia-paoi xien *dain dienio-four*.", "I (have to) do it for the child(ren)."
* **Dative**: Used for the indirect object, and for class 2 possession either in adjectival form with the postposition "ka" or independently without it. Similarly to the genitive, a "to have" construction is possible. Also used with the postoposition "oebaut" ("about")
  * Example 1 (indirect object): "Sie rue-ausoa-fioi naiet *uim poulitaikifa*!", "Don't believe a politician!"
  * Example 2 (indirect object together with a direct object): "Mie xae-xiefen-duei hein boun *duim koira*.", "I give a bone to the dog."
  * Example 3 (adjectival possession): "hai siaruc-bei-moer *haim paurein-ka*", "a brother of a parent" ("an uncle")
  * Example 4 ("to have"): "*Duim suroitifa* soe-ecoi-duei ai amio kaunis.", "The builder has a beautiful friend."
  * Example 5 (with a postoposition): "Mie xae-hioir-duei *daim haferia-oebaut*.", "I heard about the accident."
* **Locative, lative and separative**: Locative is used to indicate existing in a location or state, lative moving to a location or state and separative moving from a location or state. They are used either independently (very often, even when a suitable postposition exists) or with one of the many postpositions as found in the table below.
  * Example 1 (independent): "Mie xae-ecoi-duei *dail haim*.", "I am home."
  * Example 2 (with postposition): "Mie xae-ecoi-xoai hui pietifa-naiet *duix fuosi fieme sait*.", "I have been sober since last year."

| Postposition | Locative meaning                       | Lative meaning  | Separative meaning |
| :----------: | :------------------------------------: | :-------------: | :----------------: |

| kesik        | among                                  | (to) among      | from among         |
| ouer         | over/above                             | (to) over       | from over          |
| durix        | inside going through                   | (to) through    | (from) through     |
|||||
|||||
| aeis         | as                                     | into (a state)  | from (a state)     |
| lainen       | as similar to / as -like               | into -like      | from -like         |
| sait         | while / during (the whole duration of) | until           | since              |
| duirin       | while / during (a part of)             | before          | after              |

* **Comitative**: Used for accompaniment, telling that action is performed together with someone or accompanied by something. The postposition "naiet" ("no") can be used to tell something is done without someone.
  * Example 1 (positive): "Dui cailid xae-leikiae-duei *haik paurein*.", "The child plays with a parent."
  * Example 2 (negative): "Mie xae-feinier-heui *haik amio naiet*.", "I come without friends." (Note: this could also mean "I come with non-friend(s)". In that case "amio-naiet" would be more usually written with a hyphen, but generally the meaning is inferred from the context. To clarify, one may say "haik amio seirou", "with zero friends".)
* **Instrumental**: used to tell with which tool or by which means an action was performed. Like with comitative, the postposition "naiet" can be used to tell the deed was done without something.
  * Example 1 (positive): "Sie bue-feinier-fioi *eip torein*.", "You seem to have come by train."
  * Example 2 (negative): "Mie xae-repaer-duei xien *eip haumeir naiet*.", "I repair it without a hammer."
* **Vocative**: used to address the listener.
  * Example: "*Daif paurein*, mie xae-ecoi-heui naelai!", "Parent, I am hungry!"

#### Number
Nouns are not marked for number, and by default the number of a noun is inferred from context. However, quantifiers can be used to make the number explicit. One uses for example the adjective "mui" ("multiple") to make an explicit plural, and the numeral "uon" ("one") for explicit singular.
* Example 1 (singular): "Mie xae-xait-duei soudiu uon.", "I ate one sausage."
* Example 2 (plural): "Xiem die-ecoi-duei hai siaruc mui", "They have siblings."

#### Compounding nouns
Nouns can be compounded by putting them one after other with a compounding particle between them. They are separate words, but in writing usually combined with hyphens. The compund form takes only one article in the beginning. When compounding nouns, the first noun sets the noun class. For example, "ui koc", a cat, is a creature that lives for itself and cannot be owned. However, you may have it as a pet. A pet cat is "ai paod-bei-koc", where "bei" is a particle meaning "of type". As Shiofaioth doesn't have a generic translation for English "of", it can often be translated as a specific compounding particle. The compounding particles are listed in the following table:

| Particle | Meaning                    |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| bei      | of type                    |
| kon      | consisting of / containing |
| iuf      | used for                   |
| rel      | related to                 |
| fom      | from                       |

### Pronouns

#### Personal pronouns
The personal pronouns are listed in the following table:

| Pronoun | Meaning                           |
| ------- | --------------------------------- |
| mie     | I                                 |
| sie     | you (singular)                    |
| xie     | they (singular), he, she, it      |
| muo     | we (both inclusive and exclusive) |
| suo     | you (plural)                      |
| xuo     | they (plural)                     |

When inflected for cases, the personal pronouns take directly the corresponding article suffix.
* Example 1: "Mie xae-bailei-duei *suom*.", "I dance for you."
* Example 2: "Sie xae-teik-duei dein kietab *xiex*.", "You take the book from her."

#### Demonstrative pronouns
Shiofaioth has two demonstrative pronouns, the proximal "tae" ("this", "these") and the distal "tuo" ("that", "those"). They inflect in cases and can take postpositions, so many phrases can be derived. Locative gives "here" and "there", respectively, and with "duirin" "now" and "then". More on the time descriptions will be exxplained in the tense-like information subsection of the verbs section. The demonstrative pronouns may be used independently or adjectivally.

#### Indefinite pronouns
Shiofaioth has three indefinite pronouns: "iede" ("everything", "everyone", "every"), "auxo" ("something", "someone", "some") and "eine" ("anything", "anyone", "any"). Like the demonstrative pronouns, they inflect in cases and can be used both independently and adjectivally. Additionally, "eine" can be negated to "eine-naiet" ("nothing", "no one", "no"). However, one must be clear on what one negates. "Eine-naiet xae-ecoi-duei xuatit" means "nothing is enough", but "eine xae-ecoi-duei naiet xuatit" means "not (just) anything is enough".

#### Relative pronouns
Shiofaith has three relative pronouns. "Iokae" is a non-restrictive relative pronoun referring to a single noun phrase, "aokae" is its restrictive counterpart, and "miekae" refers to a whole proposition. They are inflected for cases. All relative clauses are separated with commas.
* Example 1 (non-restrictive): "Mie xae-laik-duei dein haus muoc-ki, iokaen xae-suroit-duei duil fuosi fieme duirin.", "I like our house, which was built last year."
* Example 2 (restrictive): "Dui moer, *aokae soe-muerairedae-fioi dain siaruc miem-ka*, soe-ecoi-paoi heil tiuraem-ien.", "The man who killed my sibling is in prison."
* Example 3 (whole proposition): "Dui aokua xae-ecoi-duei kailien, miekae miem xae-kieredae-duei suimar.", "The water is warm, which makes me want to swim."

### Adjectives and adverbs
No distinction between adjectives and adverbs is made in Shiofaioth, they are one part of speech. Attributive adjectives come after the noun they describe, and adverbs come after the verb or adjective they describe.

#### Comparison
Comparison of adjectives and adverbs is done with words "mas" ("more"), "masit" ("most"), "les" ("less") and "lesit" ("least"). These come after the adjective or adverb. The word "kuin" ("than", "like", "as") can be used in comparisons, both comparative and equative.
* Example 1 (comparative): "ei kaofei xae-ecoi-duei *xut-les kuin* ei ticai.", "Coffee is less good than tea."
* Example 2 (equative): "Sie xae-bailei-duei *coen kuin* mie.", "You dance as beautifully as I do."
* Example 3 (superlative): "Mie xae-ecoi-duei *hoix-masit* muol-kesik.", "I am the tallest of us."

#### Adjectives as nouns
Adjectives can be converted into nouns (meaning that which is described by the adjective) simply by adding an article. The noun class depends on the context.

### Numerals
Numerals work mainly like adjectives, coming after a noun that they quantify.

#### Cardinal numbers
The basic number words are listend in the following table:

| Number                       | In Shiofaioth |
| ---------------------------: | :-----------: |
| 0                            | seirou        |
| 1                            | uon           |
| 2                            | duos          |
| 3                            | ciome         |
| 4                            | neliae        |
| 5                            | faif          |
| 6                            | seis          |
| 7                            | sieben        |
| 8                            | fosiem        |
| 9                            | nao           |
| 10                           | dies          |
| 100                          | cien          |
| 1000                         | tuhat         |
| 1000 000                     | milion        |
| 1000 000 000                 | miliarid      |
| 1000 000 000 000             | bilion        |
| 1000 000 000 000 000         | biliarid      |
| 1000 000 000 000 000 000     | tirilion      |
| 1000 000 000 000 000 000 000 | tiriliarid    |

As can be seen, Shiofaioth uses the long scale in large number naming.

Compound numerals are formed with "ia" between the orders of magnitude. The name of the order of magnitude comes before the amount of it (none if one). Examples:
* "dies-ia-faif", 15
* "dies-duos", 20
* "cien-ciome-ia-dies-sieben-ia-fosiem", 378
* "tuhat-cien-faif-ia-tuhat-dies-neliae", 540 000

#### Ordinal numbers
Ordinal numbers are formed with the suffix -(i)moi, which is added to the first word of each order of magnitude. Examples:
* "uonimoi", (the) first
* "naomoi", (the) ninth
* "cienimoi-duos-ia-diesimoi-neliae-ia-siebenimoi", (the) 247th
* 
With digits, the ordinal numbers are written with "moi" added to the end, so the previous examples would be "1moi", "9moi" and "247moi".

### Verbs
All predicates in Shiofaioth have an obligatory preposition indicating mood and in the case of indicative mood also evidentiality, and an obligatory postposition indicating the voluntariness of the action. Tense- and aspect-like information may be indicated with non-obligatory particles, additional verbes etc.

#### Voluntariness
Actions are divided to five levels of voluntariness. The postpositions corresponding to each are listed in the following table:

| Level of voluntariness              | Postposition |
| ----------------------------------: | :----------: |
| Voluntary or naturally occurring    | duei         |
| Directly forced or ordered          | paoi         |
| Indirectly forced by conditions     | heui         |
| Rebellious, defiant                 | xoai         |
| Voluntariness unknown or irrelevant | fioi         |

#### Mood and evidentiality
The predicate prepositions for mood and evidentiality are listed in the following table:

| Mood, evidential                   | Preposition |
| ---------------------------------: | :---------: |
| Indicative, firsthand (or opinion) | xae         |
| Indicative, general knowledge      | die         |
| Indicative, inferential            | bue         |
| Indicative, reportative            | soe         |
| Imperative                         | rue         |
| Conditional                        | lie         |
| Interrogative                      | foe         |

* The conditional is used in more different situations than in English. In counterfactual if-sentences it is used in both the if-clause and the then-clause. It may also be used in factual if-clauses instead of the indicative, if using an evidential wouldn't make sense. In that case the then-clause takes typically the inferential indicative mood to show the factuality. The conditional may also be used in restrictive relative clauses, again if no evidential makes sense.

#### Tense- and aspect-like information
In Shiofaioth, verbs are not inflected by tense or aspect. Adverbs and phrases describing time etc. can be used to convey this information instead, if the context isn't enough. A past tense may be translated for example with the phrase "aikai-mas" ("earlier"). This is not needed if there is a specific indication of time, e.g. "duil dai fieme duirin" ("yesterday"). Similarly, a future tense can be translated with "muoehaei-mas" ("later"). A present tense can be explicitly translated with the adverb "aura" ("now", "currently"). These phrases are synonymous to "taet-duirin", "taex-duirin" and "tael-duirin", respectively. However, there is a nuance difference in immediacy. Whereas "aura" is more generally "currently", "tael-duirin" is more specifically "at this very moment". "Taet-duirin" and "taex-duirin" are more immediately before and after this moment than "aikai-mas" and "muoehaei-mas", and they can be contrasted in text or discussion.

#### Impersonal verbs, passive-like form and detransitive
There is no dummy pronoun in Shiofaioth. Instead, for impersonal verbs the subject can just be left out. For example, "it rains" translates to "xae-rein-duei". Similarly, the english passive without an agent can be translated by leaving out the subject. To emphasize the object in the same way as in the English passive, the free word order my be utilized to bring it to the front. For example, "books are loaned from the library" can be translated as "ein kietab mui die-lain-fioi feix liraeria". A passive with an agent may also be translated by bringing the object to the front and leaving the subject to the last position.

Detransitive is unmarked. That means basically that even a transitive verb can be used without an object.

#### Infinitive and participles
The infinitive is a verb without the pre- and postpositions given to a predicate. Infinitives are used by auxiliary verbs like "puedaen" ("can") and some other verbs like "kiere" ("to want"). An infinitive can also be used as a noun, meaning the action/event described by the verb, or the product of it, or sometimes (if the action has no product) the object of it. In most cases these nouns belong to class 2, as they are by definition *someone's* actions. In some cases that doesn't make sense, though, so for example "ui rein" ("rain") is a class 3 noun.
* Example 1 (infinitive verb): "Mie xae-puedaen-heui naiet *silaif*.", "I can't sleep."
* Example 2 (infinitive as a noun): "Dui loucion xae-ecoi-paoi *hai doia* miem-ka.", "The explosion was my doing."

Participles are adjectives/adverbs formed from verbs with derivational suffixes. There are three types of participles in Shiofaioth: the active or nominative participle (suffix "-(i)fa"), and two passive participles, one accusative (suffix "-(i)tafa") and the other dative (suffix "-(i)mafa"). The initial i of the suffixes will be included if the verb eds in a consonant. Similarly to verbs, participles are not inflected for tense, but can take adverbs describing the timing. Participles can have direct or indirect objects describing them, in accusative and dative, respectively.
* Example 1 (nominative participle): "ui moer baileifa", "a dancing man"
* Example 2 (accusative participle): "ai cou baileitafa", "a show that is performed by dancing"
* Example 3 (dative participle): "ui nais baileimafa", "a woman for whom a dance is performed"
* Example 4 (past participle): "ei leip xaititafa aikai mas", "a bread that has been eaten"
* Example 5 (present participle): "ei leip xaititafa aura", "a bread that is being eaten"
* Example 6 (future participle): "ei leip xaititafa muoehaei mas", "a bread that will be eaten"

#### Causative
A verbs meaning can be changed from "to do something" to "to cause someone/somehing to do something" by adding the suffix "-(e)dae" (the initial e is omitted if the verb stem ends in a vowel). If the original verb is intransitive (or copular), its subject becomes the direct object of the causative verb, taking the accusative case. If the original verb is transitive, its subject will take the dative form in the new sentence. In case the transitive verb is specifically ditransitive, there may be two different dative phrases in the sentence. If it isn't clear from the context which one is the original subject, it should come earlier in the sentence than the indirect object. The mood, evidentiality and voluntariness of the causative verb refer to the causation, not to the original verb.
* Example 1 (intransitive verb): "Sie bue-muerairedae-duei xien!", "You killed him!" ("muerair", "to die")
* Example 2 (transitive verb): "Mie xae-xaitedae-duei siem ein leip.", "I feed you some bread." ("xait", "to eat")
* Example 3 (ditransitive verb): "Xie xae-coudae-duei miem dain bailei siem.", "They made me perform the dance for you." ("cou", "to perform")
* Example 4 (copular verb): "Fei ticai xae-ecoidae-duei faelid mien." "Tea makes me happy." ("ecoi", "to be")

## Some vocabulary
The vocabulary of Shiofaioth comes from multiple source languages, including but not necessarily limited to (in alphabetical order) English, Finnish, German, Hindi, Lojban, Russian and Spanish. The words may be arbitrarily combined together, twisted to fit the phonology and ortography of Shiofaioth and otherwise mangled, and may thus not resemble much their original forms, and similarly, their meanings may not exactly match the original. Some particles are a priori.

### Question words
Shiofaioth has one basic question word, "ke" ("what", "who"). Other question words can be derived and inflected from it. "Why" is "ken-four", "where" is "kel", "whose" is "kec(-ki)" or "kem(-ka)", "how" or "what kind of" is "kel-lainen" and "when" is "kel-duirin". The question words typically, but not necessarily, start the sentence. Unlike yes-or-no questions, which use the interrogative mood, "ke"-questions typically use conditional or inferential indicative mood, but there is more variation, as the event in question may for example be observed by the one who asks the question. The "fioi" postposition is often used in questions.

### Derivational affixes
Adjectives can be turned into nouns describing the property with the ending "-(i)sus", translating to "-ness" in English. These nouns are usually class 2, but can also be class 3 if they are discussed more abstractly.

### Phrases
* "Hioxoi!", "Hello!"
* "Xae-ecoi-duei ai nautia, edaet mie xae-feinier-duei noudiaefa sien.", "It's a pleasure to get to know you." (Or simply "Nice to meet you".)
* "Kel-lainen lie-ecoi-fioi dai ficit siem-ka?", "How is your life?"
* "Foe-ficit-duei xut!", "Live well!" (When parting and not expecting to see each other again.)

There was a wall. It did not look important. It was built of uncut rocks roughly mortared. An adult could look right over it, and even a child could climb it. Where it crossed the roadway, instead of having a gate it degenerated into mere geometry, a line, an idea of boundary. But the idea was real. It was important. For seven generations there had been nothing in the world more important than that wall. (The Dispossessed, Ursula K. Le Guin, 1974)

The wolf and the dog

A hungry wolf came to an old dog and said: "Good Friend, I am so hungry that I cannot sleep.  You, however are big and fat.  Where do you get your food? Where do you live?  Where do you eat?"

"I am the servant of my master," answered the dog.  "I serve my master, I guard my master's house.  Therefore, my master gives me as much to eat as I want."

Then the wolf said, "I live very poorly.  Day and night I roam through the woods and fields and find nothing to eat for my wife and my children.  I can no longer live this way.  My wife and children are dying of hunger. Therefore, I shall also become a servant of men and guard their houses."

The dog and the wolf ran together through the woods to the dog's house. Suddenly the wolf sees the dog's neck.  He is astonished and says:  "I see your neck is without hair.  Do all dogs have necks without hair? "

"No," answered the dog.  "Not all dogs.  I wear a chain in the daytime. During the day I lay in front of my master's house on a chain.  The chain is iron and iron is hard.  Therefore I have no hair on my neck.  But at night I am free.  During the night I roam wherever I wish."

"Dear brother," said the wolf to the dog.  "Hunger is hard, but the chain is harder.  I wear no chain and will not wear one.  Better that I die from hunger with my wife and children.  Run alone back to your master.  It is better to be hungry than fat; it is better to be free than to wear a chain. Farewell." (From an old German Reader (circa 1933), translated to English by David The Grey Wizard. [Source.](https://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9912D&L=conlang&P=R3500))

From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there – on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known. (Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space, Carl Sagan, 1994. Quoted from Wikipedia.)
