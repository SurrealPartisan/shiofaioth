# Shiofaioth (Ciofaiod)
Shiofaioth is an anarchist and feminist engineered language (engelang). It's purpose is to be as unsuitable for authoritarian propaganda as possible, so that it is difficult to hide power structures behind word choices. Shiofaioth is a work in progress, and this document will be updated.

## Grammar

### Nouns
Nouns in Shiofaioth are preceded by articles. An article consists of three parts: a prefix indicating definiteness and specificity (can be none), a base form indicating noun class, and a suffix indicating case (can be none).

#### Noun classes
Nouns are divided into three classes:

1. things that can be owned in functional sense or naturally belong to someone: my food, your car, her body. Class 1 uses article base form "ei".

2. things that can't necessarily be owned, but which can be named so that they are defined by someone's (or something's?) relationship to them: my home, your pet, his boyfriend. Class 2 uses article base form "ai".

3. things that exist for themselves: a human, the weather, the world. Class 3 uses article base form "ui".

#### Definiteness and specificity
The prefix of an article indicates both [definiteness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness) and [specificity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specificity_(linguistics)) of the noun. They are as follows:

|                 | Definite | Indefinite |
| --------------: | :------: | :--------: |
| **Specific**    | d-       | h-         |
| **Nonspecific** | f-       | -          |

For example, here are four translations for the sentence "I am looking for my mother":
 
* "Mie eiciae miec-ka *dain* paurein-bei-nais."  
(definite, specific)  
Interpretation: I have one mother, whom I know, and I am trying to find her.

* "Mie eiciae miec-ka *fain* paurein-bei-nais."  
(definite, nonspecific)  
Interpretation: I don't know who my one and only mother is, but I am trying to find her.

* "Mie eiciae miec-ka *hain* paurein-bei-nais."  
(indefinite, specific)  
Interpretation: I am trying to find a certain one of my multiple mothers.

* "Mie eiciae miec-ka *ain* paurein-bei-nais."  
(indefinite, nonspecific)  
Interpretation: I am trying to find any one of my multiple mothers.

These are potentially not the only possible interpretations, but should illuminate the meanings of definiteness and specificity.
