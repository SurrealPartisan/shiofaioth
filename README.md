# Shiofaioth (Ciofaiod)
Shiofaioth is an anarchist and feminist engineered language (engelang). It's purpose is to be as unsuitable for authoritarian propaganda as possible, so that it is difficult to hide power structures behind word choices. A secondary goal is certain kind of airy, whispery aesthetics. Shiofaioth is a work in progress, and this document will be updated.

## Phonology and ortography
### Consonants

|               | Bilabial | Labiodental | Dental | Alveolar | Postalveolar | Lateral | Velar | Uvular | Glottal |
| ------------: | :------: | :---------: | :----: | :------: | :----------: | :-----: | :---: | :----: | :-----: |
| **Plosive**   | p        |             | t      |          |              |         | k     |        |         |
| **Nasal**     | m        |             | n      |          |              |         |       |        |         |
| **Fricative** | b        | f           | d      | s        | c            | l       | x     | r      | h       |

The plosives are aspirated and voiceless, the nasals are voiced and the fricatives are voiceless. The uvular fricative may also be pronounced as a trill.

### Vowels

|           | Front | Back  |
| --------: | :---: | :---: |
| **Close** | i     | u*    |
| **Mid**   | e     | o*    |
| **Open**  |       | a     |

An asterisk marks rounded vowels.

All possible diphthongs and thriphthongs are allowed.

### Phonotactics
The syllable structure in Shiofaioth is (C)V(C), where V can be a monophthong, diphthong or triphthong. The beginning consonant can be omitted in a word-initial syllable, and the ending consonant may only be present on a word-final syllable. Thus, there are no consonant clusters. As postpositions and other particles are often connected to other words with hyphens, that may seem to break this rule, but they are technically separate words. The connecting is done for aesthetics and clarity.

### Stress
The stress is on the last syllable of the word.

## Grammar

### Nouns
Nouns in Shiofaioth are preceded by articles. An article consists of three parts: a prefix indicating definiteness and specificity (can be none), a base form indicating noun class, and a suffix indicating case (can be none).

#### Noun classes
Nouns are divided into three classes:

1. things that can be owned in functional sense or naturally belong to someone: my food, your car, her body. Class 1 uses article base form "ei".

2. things that can't necessarily be owned, but which can be named so that they are defined by someone's (or something's?) relationship to them: my home, your pet, his boyfriend. Class 2 uses article base form "ai".

3. things that exist for themselves: a human, the weather, the world. Class 3 uses article base form "ui".

When compounding nouns, the first noun sets the class. For example, "ui koc", a cat, is a creature that lives for itself and cannot be owned. However, you may have it as a pet. A pet cat is "ai paod-bei-koc", where "bei" is a particle meaning "of type".

Proper nouns may be used without article when the case is obvious. If an article is needed, a class 3 article is used.

#### Definiteness and specificity
The prefix of an article indicates both [definiteness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness) and [specificity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specificity_(linguistics)) of the noun. They are as follows:

|                 | Definite | Indefinite |
| --------------: | :------: | :--------: |
| **Specific**    | d-       | h-         |
| **Nonspecific** | f-       | -          |

For example, here are four translations for the sentence "I am looking for my mother":
 
* "Mie xae-eiciae-duei *dain* paurein-bei-nais miem-ka."  
(definite, specific)  
Interpretation: I have one mother, whom I know, and I am trying to find her.

* "Mie xae-eiciae-duei *fain* paurein-bei-nais miem-ka."  
(definite, nonspecific)  
Interpretation: I don't know who my one and only mother is, but I am trying to find her.

* "Mie xae-eiciae-duei *hain* paurein-bei-nais miem-ka."  
(indefinite, specific)  
Interpretation: I am trying to find a certain one of my multiple mothers.

* "Mie xae-eiciae-duei *ain* paurein-bei-nais miem-ka."  
(indefinite, nonspecific)  
Interpretation: I am trying to find any one of my multiple mothers.

These are potentially not the only possible interpretations, but should illuminate the meanings of definiteness and specificity.

#### Noun cases
Shiofaioth has nine noun cases, each marked with an article suffix as listed in the following table:

| Case         | Suffix |
| -----------: | :----: |
| Nominative   | -      |
| Genitive     | -c     |
| Accusative   | -n     |
| Dative       | -m     |
| Locative     | -l     |
| Lative       | -t     |
| Separative   | -x     |
| Comitative   | -k     |
| Instrumental | -p     |

The cases are used as follows:
* **Nominative**: Used for the subject of a sentence, and often for a predicative.
  * Example 1 (subject): "*Dai uicieteir* xae-bailei-duei.", "The teacher is dancing."
  * Example 2 (predicative): "Mie xae-ecoi-duei *hui peib*", "I am a non-binary person."
* **Genitive** Used for class 1 possession, either in adjectival form with the postposition "ki" or independently (usually as a predicative) without it.
  * Example 1 (adjectival form): "dei haumeir *duic raiboudeir-ki*", "the hammer of the worker"
  * Example 2 (independent form): "Dei leip xae-ecoi-duei *duic kouofeiteir*.", "The bread is the cook's."
* **Accusative**: Used for the direct object and with postpositions "four" ("for") and "koaxein" ("against" in the non-physical sense).
  * Example 1 (direct object): "Hai toroic xae-baisen-xoai *hain poulais*.", "a tortoise bites a cop (defiantly)".
  * Example 2 (with a postposition): "Mie xae-doia-paoi xien dain dienio-four.", "I (have to) do it for the child(ren)."
* **Dative**: Used for the indirect object, and for class 2 possession either in adjectival form with the postposition "ka" or independently without it.
  * Example 1 (indirect object): "Sie rue-ausoa-fioi naiet *uim poulitaikeir*!", "Don't believe a politician!"
  * Example 2 (adjectival possession): "hai siaruc-bei-moer *haim paurein-ka*", "a brother of a parent" ("an uncle")
* **Locative, lative and separative**: Locative is used to indicate existing in a location or state, lative moving to a location or state and separative moving from a location or state. They are used either independently or with one of the many postpositions as found in the table below.
  * Example 1 (independent): "Mie xae-xiefen-duei hein boun *duit koira*.", "I give a bone to the dog."
  * Example 2 (with postposition): "Mie xae-ecoi-xoai hui pieteir-naiet *duix fuosi fieme sait*.", "I have been sober since last year."

| Postposition | Locative meaning                       | Lative meaning | Separative meaning |
| :----------: | :------------------------------------: | :------------: | :----------------: |
| ien          | in                                     | into           | from inside of     |
| oan          | on                                     | onto           | from the top of    |
| lou          | below/under                            | to below       | from below         |
| caid         | beside / next to                       | to beside      | from beside        |
| nier         | near                                   | (to) near      | from near          |
|||||

| aeis         | as                                     | into (a state) | from (a state)     |
| sait         | while / during (the whole duration of) | until          | since              |
| duirin       | while / during (a part of)             | before         | after              |

* **Comitative**: Used for accompaniment, telling that action is performed together with someone (or rarely something). The postposition "naiet" ("no") can be used to tell something is done without someone.
  * Example 1 (positive): "Dui cailid xae-leikiae-duei haik paurein.", "The child plays with a parent."
  * Example 2 (negative): "Mie xae-feinier-heui haik amio naiet.", "I come without friends." (Note: this could also mean "I come with non-friend(s)". In that case "amio-naiet" would be more usually written with a hyphen, but generally the meaning is contextual.)
* **Instrumental**: used to tell with which tool or by which means an action was performed. Like with comitative, the postposition "naiet" can be used to tell the deed was done without something.
  * Example 1 (positive): "Sie bue-feinier-fioi eip torein.", "You seem to have come by train."
  * Example 2 (negative): "Mie xae-repaer-duei xien eip haumeir naiet.", "I repair it without a hammer."

### Verbs
All predicates in Shiofaioth have an obligatory preposition indicating mood and in the case of indicative mood also evidentiality, and an obligatory postposition indicating the voluntariness of the action. Tense- and aspect-like information may be indicated with non-obligatory particles, additional verbes etc.

#### Voluntariness
Actions are divided to five levels of voluntariness. The postpositions corresponding to each are listed in the following table:

| Level of voluntariness              | Postposition |
| ----------------------------------: | :----------: |
| Voluntary or naturally occurring    | duei         |
| Directly forced or ordered          | paoi         |
| Indirectly forced by conditions     | heui         |
| Rebellious, defiant                 | xoai         |
| Voluntariness unknown or irrelevant | fioi         |

#### Mood and evidentiality
The predicate prepositions for mood and evidentiality are listed in the following table:

| Mood                    | Preposition |
| ----------------------: | :---------: |
| Indicative, firsthand   | xae         |
