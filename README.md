# Shiofaioth (Ciofaiod)
Shiofaioth is an anarchist and feminist engineered language (engelang). It's purpose is to be as unsuitable for authoritarian propaganda as possible, so that it is difficult to hide power structures behind word choices. Shiofaioth is a work in progress, and this document will be updated.

## Phonology and ortography
### Consonants

|               | Bilabial | Labiodental | Dental | Alveolar | Postalveolar | Lateral | Velar | Uvular | Glottal |
| ------------: | :------: | :---------: | :----: | :------: | :----------: | :-----: | :---: | :----: | :-----: |
| **Plosive**   | p        |             | t      |          |              |         | k     |        |         |
| **Nasal**     | m        |             | n      |          |              |         |       |        |         |
| **Fricative** | b        | f           | d      | s        | c            | l       | x     | r      | h       |

The plosives are aspirated and voiceless, the nasals are voiced and the fricatives are voiceless. The uvular fricative may also be pronounced as a trill.

### Vowels

|           | Front | Back  |
| --------: | :---: | :---: |
| **Close** | i     | u*    |
| **Mid**   | e     | o*    |
| **Open**  |       | a     |

An asterisk marks rounded vowels.

All possible diphthongs and thriphthongs are allowed.

### Phonotactics
The syllable structure in Shiofaioth is (C)V(C), where V can be a monophthong, diphthong or triphthong. The beginning consonant can be omitted in a word-initial syllable, and the ending consonant may only be present on a word-final syllable. Thus, there are no consonant clusters. As postpositions and other particles are often connected to other words with hyphens, thay may seem to break this rule, but they are technically separate words. The connecting is done for aesthetics and clarity.

## Grammar

### Nouns
Nouns in Shiofaioth are preceded by articles. An article consists of three parts: a prefix indicating definiteness and specificity (can be none), a base form indicating noun class, and a suffix indicating case (can be none).

#### Noun classes
Nouns are divided into three classes:

1. things that can be owned in functional sense or naturally belong to someone: my food, your car, her body. Class 1 uses article base form "ei".

2. things that can't necessarily be owned, but which can be named so that they are defined by someone's (or something's?) relationship to them: my home, your pet, his boyfriend. Class 2 uses article base form "ai".

3. things that exist for themselves: a human, the weather, the world. Class 3 uses article base form "ui".

When compounding nouns, the first noun sets the class. For example, "ui koc", a cat, is a creature that lives for itself and cannot be owned. However, you may have it as a pet. A pet cat is "ai paod-bei-koc", where "bei" is a particle meaning "of type".

Proper nouns may be used without article when the case is obvious. If an article is needed, a class 3 article is used.

#### Definiteness and specificity
The prefix of an article indicates both [definiteness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness) and [specificity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specificity_(linguistics)) of the noun. They are as follows:

|                 | Definite | Indefinite |
| --------------: | :------: | :--------: |
| **Specific**    | d-       | h-         |
| **Nonspecific** | f-       | -          |

For example, here are four translations for the sentence "I am looking for my mother":
 
* "Mie xae-eiciae-duei *dain* paurein-bei-nais miec-ka."  
(definite, specific)  
Interpretation: I have one mother, whom I know, and I am trying to find her.

* "Mie xae-eiciae-duei *fain* paurein-bei-nais miec-ka."  
(definite, nonspecific)  
Interpretation: I don't know who my one and only mother is, but I am trying to find her.

* "Mie xae-eiciae-duei *hain* paurein-bei-nais miec-ka."  
(indefinite, specific)  
Interpretation: I am trying to find a certain one of my multiple mothers.

* "Mie xae-eiciae-duei *ain* paurein-bei-nais miec-ka."  
(indefinite, nonspecific)  
Interpretation: I am trying to find any one of my multiple mothers.

These are potentially not the only possible interpretations, but should illuminate the meanings of definiteness and specificity.

#### Noun cases

| Case         | Suffix |

### Verbs
All predicates in Shiofaioth have an obligatory preposition indicating mood and in the case of indicative mood also evidentiality, and an obligatory postposition indicating the voluntariness of the action. Tense- and aspect-like information may be indicated with non-obligatory particles.

| Rebellious                          | xoai         |
| Voluntariness unknown or irrelevant | fioi         |

#### Mood and evidentiality
